# Trajectory optimization and simulation

## Preparation

Make sure you have installed packages: pymprog, numpy, pandas, matplotlib. If you haven't, install them before you start your demo.
This simulation was based on VisSim 11.00-13. 

## How to start

First, download all the files into folder named "Intersection".

Second, creat folders "vissim_scripts" and "Results" under the folder "Intersection".

Third, move files "CAV_algorithm_zkh_modified-202004.py" and "read_output.py" and "boot_externally.py" to folder "vissim_scripts" (as mentioned in step 2).

Fourth, change the directory in the file "boot_externally.py", near the vicinity lines of line 8.
